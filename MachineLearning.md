Machine Learning is a form of artificial intelligence

Steps:
1. import the data
2. clean the data - it's really important to do this so our model doesn't learn bad patterns
3. split the data into training/test sets
4. create a model
5. Train the model - important to use a lot of data to improve accuracy
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate and improve


Libraries and Tools:
1. Numpy - provides multidimensial array
2. Pandas - provides data anylaysis/data frames
3. MatPlotLib - 2D creates graphs and plots
4. Scikit-Learn - provides common algorithms like decision trees and neural networks


Use Jupyter to visualize and inspect the data much easier than an editor
Can use this on a platform called Anaconda

Machine Learning Project (Music Streaming):
Imagine we have an online music store. We our users sign up we ask their age and gender.
Based on their profile, we'll recommend various music albums they are likely to buy.
We want to use machine learning to increase sales.
We will feed our model with data so we can ask it to make predictions.
